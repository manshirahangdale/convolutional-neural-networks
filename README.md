# Convolutional Neural Networks

## Concepts Covered
- Difference between ANN and CNN
- Convolution and filters
- Pooling layers
- Flattening
- CNN architecture in TensorFlow/Keras
- Basic image classification workflow

## Learning Sources
- TensorFlow official documentation
- Online lectures for conceptual clarity

## Files
- `CNN_Learning_Notes.ipynb` – Main learning notebook

## Observations
- CNNs significantly outperform ANN for image data because spatial information is preserved.
- Increasing model depth improves feature extraction but also increases overfitting risk.
- Pooling layers help reduce computation but may discard fine-grained details.
- Proper normalization and regularization are important for stable training.
