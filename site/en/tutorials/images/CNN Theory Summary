- CNNs are designed to work with grid-like data such as images.
- Convolution layers extract spatial features using learnable filters.
- Pooling layers reduce spatial dimensions and computational cost.
- Flattening converts feature maps into a vector for dense layers.
- CNNs preserve spatial relationships better than ANN for image data.
